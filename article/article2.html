    Catalytic converters: elements such as palladium can act as a catalyst that removes harmful substances.<br>
    2CO(g) + 2NO(g) -> 2CO2(g) +N2(g) <br>
    Neutralization of acidic water: bases can be used to neutralize acidic water:<br>
    CaO(s) + H2SO4(aq) -> CaSO4(aq) + H2O (l)<br>
    Ca(OH)2(s) + H2SO4(aq) -> CaSO4(aq) + 2H2O (l)<br>
    Hydrodesulfurization: catalysts can be used to remove sulfur from fuels such as natural gas and petroleum which will reduce the sulfur dioxide emissions when fuels are burned <br>

    1. Use degradable material<br><br>
    <img src="/picture/howlong.png"><br>
    Plastics, styrofoams, glass and chemical batteries are an example of Non-bio degradable material. <br>
    It takes hundreds of years to break down and can have a detrimental effect on soil. <br>
    One way to reduce use of Non-degradable material is to start the 3Rs. Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. <br>
    For example, a milk bottle can be reused for different purposes before it goes into a rubbish bin. <br>
    And think twice before using disposable products. Using a tumbler instead of plastic & paper cups would be much more efficient.<br>
     Lastly, recycle as much as you can. Recycling aluminium cans can save 95% of the energy needed to produce new cans from raw materials. <br>
     Most of the products can be recycled. Throwing out products as rubbish will make more landfills. <br>
     Which affects the Earth’s ecosystem in a negative way. Try to be aware of the 3Rs and keep a sustainable lifestyle.<br><br>
    2. Save water<br><br>
    <img src="/picture/guide_waterpollution.jpg"><br>
    Many people have a habit of using water without any awareness. <br>
    Water is an essential source which is crucial for the ecosystem. <br>
    However, water isn’t unlimited. 71% of the Earth is covered with water and only 0.5% is available as freshwater. <br>
    And with 0.5%, humans use it for agriculture, drinking, industrial usage and sanitation. <br>
    It might be difficult to reduce water usage for agriculture and industrial usage. <br>
    Yet, people can change daily habits such as showers and tap water usage. Taking shorter showers can help reduce unnecessary water usage.<br>
     An average person  uses 5 gallons of water per minute. If you manage to shorten shower time by 5 minutes, it reduces 25 gallons of water consumption.  <br>
     Implementing a water saver at home can also help control water usage. Also, Check for leaks at home to prevent any leakage. <br>
     Overuse of water not only causes desertification but also water pollution. Chemicals used in factories and homes flow into the ocean, causing harm to marine ecosystems.<br>
      So start right now. Even a small change in habits like taking shorter showers can make a big difference. <br>
      Saving water isn’t just for humans, it’s for Earth.
