    Third Article: Other Major Environmental Issues

    1. Loss of Biodiversity:
</h1>
<p>
    Biodiversity refers to the variation in species, number of genes, individuals within species and the biological community in different regions. <br>
    The loss of habitat that leads to lack of food resources and pollution that leads to health problems in organisms are two of the causes of loss <br>
    of biodiversity. It is important to maintain biodiversity because lack of biodiversity can lower the food production in an ecosystem and create a <br>
    disturbance in an ecosystem. It also affects humans economically, as we rely on various organisms as food resources.

    2. Climate Change:
</h1>
<p>
    <img src="/picture/globalwarming.jpg"><br>
    Climate change is when there are major changes in the long-term pattern of weather. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are one of <br>
    the causes of climate change, they are released from human activities such as transportation and industrial activities. These gases trap heat in the <br>
    atmosphere, which leads to increased temperature. The effects of climate change include melting glaciers, increased natural disasters, sea level rise,<br>
     extinction and more. For instance, as the average temperature increases, the rate of water evaporation increased and led to droughts, which contributed<br>
      to more than $10 billion loss to agriculture

    3. Waste Disposal:
</h1>
<p>
    Average person produces 4.3 pounds of waste per day and the amount of waste produced is overwhelming to the environment. As wastes are buried in landfills,<br>
     they can produce methane gas which again contributes to the greenhouse effect. Materials such as plastics are not biodegradable and they also release<br> toxins harmful to the environment.

    4. Deforestation: 
</h1>
<p>
    Deforestation is clearing forest and trees to use the land for other purposes. Such as, plantation, grazing and urbanization. Deforestation is a serious<br>
     problem in modern times. What makes it worse is that deforestation can cause other major environmental issues. First, climate change. Trees and plants use<br>
      carbon dioxide and water as main sources of energy. When it receives sunlight, it converts carbon dioxide and water into sugar and oxygen. Sugar is used <br>
      as energy and Oxygen is released into the atmosphere. According to ucsusa, deforestation is responsible for about 10 percent of carbon dioxide emission.<br>
       Continuing deforestation disables carbon dioxide purification and causes distraction in climate patterns. Carbon dioxide will likely increase due to the<br>
        growing population. Second, loss of biodiversity. Both humans and animals rely on forests. Rainforest only covers 7 percent of the earth but provides habitat<br>
         for more than half of the world living creatures(link). Forests also provide jobs for humans such as, plantation, grazing and mining. However, excessive<br>
          deforestation has been causing extinction of species, natural disasters and break down of the food web.
