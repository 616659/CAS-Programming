    First Article: Acid Deposition and Its Effects & Ozone Depletion

    Acid Deposition
</h1>
<p>
    Naturally, when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves in water, 
    it forms carbonic acid, which is responsible for the acidity of rain: <br>
    CO2(g) + H2O (l) ->  H2CO3(aq). Acid deposition is when additional acidic 
    substances from the atmosphere go through chemical processes that increase <br>
    acidity of the environment.

    Causes of Acid Deposition
</h1>
<p>
    Emissions from chemical reactions such as combustion of fossil fuels and industrial processes. Fossil fuels often contain sulfur and when this <br>
    sulfur-containing fossil fuel combusts for energy, it produces sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide then reacts with oxygen in the air to produce sulfur <br>
    trioxide. Sulfur dioxide reacts with water to produce sulfurous acid and sulfur trioxide reacts with water to produce sulfuric acid, both causing increased acidity.<br>
     Nitrogen oxides are another chemical responsible for acid deposition. Nitrogen oxides are produced from nuclear plants and internal combustion engines. <br>
     Nitrogen reacts with oxygen to produce nitrogen dioxide and nitrogen dioxide reacts with water to produce nitrous acid and nitric acid.

    Effects of Acid Deposition
</h1>
<p>
    Acid decomposition is caused by acidic gases such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that dissolve in water to form acids such as nitric acid,<br>
     sulfuric acid and sulfurous acid. When the pH of water decreases, it affects organisms that live around. Nitrates in nitric acid will cause eutrophication<br>
      in lakes and damage the gill operation of fish. Eutrophication is when an environment is rich in nutrients that causes excessive growth of algae, and some<br>
       of the algae can produce toxins harmful for other organisms in the habitat (2). Also at a low pH level, aluminium ions can be released, harmful to the plants<br>
        and animals (3) (4). Not only acid deposition has environmental effects, it also influences building materials. Acidic particles can lead to metal corrosion <br>
        and cause materials such as paint to decay more quickly (4).

    Ozone Depletion
</h1>
<br>
    <img src="/picture/ozone.jpg"> 
<p>
    Ozone (O3)  in the atmosphere acts as shields that prevents harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching the surface. However, chlorofluorocarbons and nitrous oxides produced from human activities catalyzes the breakdown of oxygen. It can lead to problems like increased skin damage risk (6).
    <br>
    CFC:
    <br>
    CCl2F2 -UV> CClF2+Cl.
    <br>
    Cl.+O3->ClO.+O2
    <br>
    ClO.+O3->Cl.+2O2
    <br>
    The chlorine free radical again breaks down ozone.

    NOx:
    <br>
    NO.+O3->NO2.+O2
    <br>
    NO2+O3->NO.+2O2
    <br>
    NO2-UV>NO.+O., O.+O3->2O2
    <br>
    Net Equation: 2O3->3O2
