    <h1>About Us</h1>
        <h2>Environmental Science at the International School of Busan: 
            We are a group of highschool students at the International School of Busan (ISB) in South Korea who are deeply concerned with contemporary environmental issues. 
            In response to these issues, we are endeavoring to research and program an educational website for all viewers. 
            From this, we are looking forward to learning and sharing our knowledge about these issues and their solutions. 
            As DP students, we are doing this as our CAS project as part of the Diploma Programme(DP) to initiate our plan and work collabratively to achieve a common goal.             
            </h2>
        <h2>To inform people of all ages with contemporary environmental issues by providing insight into the science behind these issues</h2>
